**Building a Scikit_Learn model with reference to custom defined transformer and using it in Watson Machine Learning service.**

This project contains a sample notebook that trains a Scikit-Learn model with custom defined transformer as one of the stage in the `Pipeline` and uses Watson Machine Learning service to deploy and score using the trained model as a REST service. 

The project also contains the python Library containing user defined transformer that will be used in the Scikit-Learn model.
