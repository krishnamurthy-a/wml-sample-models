**Building a TensorFlow model with reference to custom defined tensor operation and using it in Watson Machine Learning service.**

This project contains a sample notebook that trains a TensorFlow model with custom defined tensor operation as one of the tensor in the graph and uses Watson Machine Learning service to deploy and score using the trained model as a REST service. 

The project also contains the python Library that contains code for custom tensor operation initialization required by Watson Machine Learning service for online deployment and scoring of a TensorFlow model.
